# MiniNet
Creator: Charles Galea (S3688570)

The purpose of this project is to create a social network. A social network, in the simplest sense, is
a collection of connections linking a set of people. Each person has a “profile” in the social
network. To do this I created a interactive network called MiniNet containing profile information (i.e. name, age status, profile image, 
friends, parents and children. The program allows the user to add, search, modify and dalete profiles.

This project was an assignment completed for the course Advanced Programming as part of the Master of Data Science course at 
RMIT (Melbourne, Australia).
